Getting Help
************

Joxa is in an early stage. So, for now, the Joxa community is the
Erlware community. We use the erlware-questions and erlware-dev
mailing lists (see below). We also make heavy use of the github issues
and wiki. Make use of all these resources for your information needs.

Resources
---------

1. [Erlware Questions](http://groups.google.com/group/erlware-questions)
   Is a general list for questions and discussion around Erlware
   projects, including Joxa. It should be your first stop if you have
   questions.

2. [Erlware Dev](http://groups.google.com/group/erlware-dev) If you
   are interested in developing and contributing to an Erlware
   project, including Joxa, this is the place you should go.

3. [Joxa Issues](https://github.com/erlware/joxa/issues)

4. [Joxa Wiki](https://github.com/erlware/joxa/wiki)
